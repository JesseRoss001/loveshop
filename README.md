In the initial design phase of Be Mine Boutique, we utilized Figma to create a comprehensive wireframe, providing a visual blueprint for the e-commerce platform. Figma's collaborative features facilitated real-time teamwork, ensuring a cohesive visualization of the user interface. The wireframe outlines essential elements, including navigation menus and product displays, guiding a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Deployment

### Version Control

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

- git add - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

- git commit -m “commit message” - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

- git push - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Deployment Steps on Heroku

This project, developed for [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), is a Django-based application that enables users to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.


1. **Create a New App:**
   - Select "New" in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard and choose "Create new app" from the dropdown menu.
   - Choose a unique app name, select a region (EU or USA), and click "Create App."

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - From the app's Settings, click "Reveal Config Vars" and set your environment variables:
     | Key | Value |
     | CLOUDINARY_URL | user's own value |
     | DATABASE_URL | user's own value |
     | DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1 (temporary) |
     | SECRET_KEY | user's own value |

3. **Install Requirements and Create Procfile:**
   - Install project requirements using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Create a Procfile with `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile` (replace app_name with your Django app name).
   - replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

 - Select Automatic Deployment from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: heroku login -i
- Set the remote for Heroku: heroku git:remote -a app_name (replace app_name with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type:
  - git push heroku main

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

## Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the requirements.txt file.

1. **Install Requirements and Configure Environment:**
   - Install project requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
   - Create `env.py` at the root level with your environment variables.

2. **Run the Project Locally:**
   - Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
   - Make migrations and migrate: `python3 manage.py makemigrations` and `python3 manage.py migrate`
   - Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
   - Load fixtures if needed: `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json`
   - Run the app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

## Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard

5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
git clone The Link
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Forking
By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository. You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
