## UX

In the initial design phase of Love Shop, we utilized Figma to create a comprehensive wireframe, providing a visual blueprint for the e-commerce platform. Figma's collaborative features facilitated real-time teamwork, ensuring a cohesive visualization of the user interface. The wireframe outlines essential elements, including navigation menus and product displays, guiding a seamless and intuitive user experience.

[Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/wKzMN7lJ3J6kuoPx5ZbyCn/Wireframe?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=vupIF9MRZJLTBluZ-0)



## User stories

The integration of user stories derived from our wireframe designs on the Project Board has been instrumental. It provided a clear linkage between design concepts and functional requirements, ensuring that the development team was aligned with the envisioned user experience. This connection between design and implementation has been crucial in delivering a product that not only meets technical specifications but also aligns seamlessly with the intended user journey.

## Testing

Be Mine Boutique underwent thorough manual testing during development and post-deployment to ensure a robust and user-friendly experience. For a detailed summary of our manual testing efforts, please refer to [this document](test.md).

## Deployment

### Version Control

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

- git add - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

- git commit -m “commit message” - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

- git push - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Deployment Steps on Heroku

This project, developed for [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), is a Django-based application that enables users to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.


1. **Create a New App:**
   - Select "New" in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard and choose "Create new app" from the dropdown menu.
   - Choose a unique app name, select a region (EU or USA), and click "Create App."

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - From the app's Settings, click "Reveal Config Vars" and set your environment variables:
     | Key | Value |
     | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
     | CLOUDINARY_URL | user's own value |
     | DATABASE_URL | user's own value |
     | DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1 (temporary) |
     | SECRET_KEY | user's own value |

3. **Install Requirements and Create Procfile:**
   - Install project requirements using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Create a Procfile with `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile` (replace app_name with your Django app name).
   - replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

 - Select Automatic Deployment from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: heroku login -i
- Set the remote for Heroku: heroku git:remote -a app_name (replace app_name with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type:
  - git push heroku main

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

## Local Deployment

   - Create `env.py` at the root level with your environment variables.

2. **Run the Project Locally:**
   - Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
   - Make migrations and migrate: `python3 manage.py makemigrations` and `python3 manage.py migrate`
   - Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
   - Load fixtures if needed: `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json`
   - Run the app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
