## Validator Testing
### HTML
To test the markup validity [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was run on each of the three pages of The Gourmet Cake Club website. There were no errors or warnings detected.

### CSS
A [CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to check the validity of the CSS code of the website. There were no errors or warnings detected.

### Light House Analysis
Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools was used to assess the performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO rating of the website. This analysis was run throughout the website development with recommendations implemented accordingly to improve the score. This included compressing image sizes, adjusting contrast ratio for links and adding a meta description.

The Lighthouse analysis was run on both mobile and desktop devices and the results are illustrated below:

# Lighthouse Performance Testing Summary


## Personal Overview on Mobile Performance

- **Current Performance Score**: The low performance score for the mobile version is by design, due to the inclusion of carousel images. Despite their compression, these images significantly affect the overall score.

## Efforts Implemented

- **Image Optimization**: I have compressed the carousel images to reduce the load time, which is a known factor in performance scoring.

## Future Developments

- **Adopting Next-Generation Images**: In my next sprint, I plan to utilize next-generation images to further improve performance. This should offer a better balance between image quality and file size, leading to improved load times.

## Design Considerations

- **Accessibility and Color Usage**: Accessibility and thoughtful color usage have been paramount in my design process. Ensuring that our site is usable for all, including those with disabilities, has been a key factor in our design choices.

## Conclusion

I am dedicated to continuously enhancing our mobile site's performance and user experience. The forthcoming updates are poised to address the existing bottlenecks, with an expectation of a substantial improvement in our performance metrics.

---

*Note: This report reflects my commitment to site optimization and user-centric design. The performance metrics are periodically reviewed and updated in line with new optimizations and feature rollouts.*

# Feature Testing

- **Instructor Signup**: Instructors signing up should provide a 4-digit card number or lower. This is to demonstrate the concept initially, with plans to later restrict the accepted card numbers and implement in-person verification for added security.

- **Event Search and Creation**: Instructors can search for events for inspiration, held by other instructors or officials. 
    - On clicking 'Create Event', instructors can schedule a new event. The date and time combination must be unique to prevent double bookings. Event time cannot be set in the past, and the capacity limit is 60. 
    - Optional event details or an image can be added.

    **Note**: An error related to image upload has been identified and will be addressed.

### Search Event Access
- **Objective**: Confirm that non-logged-in members cannot search events.
- **Expected Behavior**: Restricted access.
- **Result**: Non logged in members cannot access search features.

### Event Booking Visibility
- **Objective**: Assess if event booking details are hidden from non-logged-in members.
- **Expected Behavior**: Booking details should not be visible.
- **Result**: ![Event Booking Test](https://github.com/JesseRoss001/Community-Center/assets/79084912/d02c91fc-7ab5-4124-a8dd-6f201257914a)
