# Lighthouse Performance Testing Summary


## Personal Overview on Mobile Performance

- **Current Performance Score**: The low performance score for the mobile version is by design, due to the inclusion of carousel images. Despite their compression, these images significantly affect the overall score.

## Efforts Implemented

- **Image Optimization**: I have compressed the carousel images to reduce the load time, which is a known factor in performance scoring.

## Future Developments

- **Adopting Next-Generation Images**: In my next sprint, I plan to utilize next-generation images to further improve performance. This should offer a better balance between image quality and file size, leading to improved load times.

## Design Considerations

- **Accessibility and Color Usage**: Accessibility and thoughtful color usage have been paramount in my design process. Ensuring that our site is usable for all, including those with disabilities, has been a key factor in our design choices.

## Conclusion

I am dedicated to continuously enhancing our mobile site's performance and user experience. The forthcoming updates are poised to address the existing bottlenecks, with an expectation of a substantial improvement in our performance metrics.

---

*Note: This report reflects my commitment to site optimization and user-centric design. The performance metrics are periodically reviewed and updated in line with new optimizations and feature rollouts.*

# Feature Testing

- **Instructor Signup**: Instructors signing up should provide a 4-digit card number or lower. This is to demonstrate the concept initially, with plans to later restrict the accepted card numbers and implement in-person verification for added security.

- **Event Search and Creation**: Instructors can search for events for inspiration, held by other instructors or officials. 
    - On clicking 'Create Event', instructors can schedule a new event. The date and time combination must be unique to prevent double bookings. Event time cannot be set in the past, and the capacity limit is 60. 
    - Optional event details or an image can be added.

    **Note**: An error related to image upload has been identified and will be addressed.

# Defensive Programming Test: Join Event

## Overview
This report evaluates the security and user experience aspects of the `join_event` functionality in the Community Center project.

## Test Scenarios

### Non-Logged-In Member Access
- **Objective**: Verify access control for non-logged-in users.
- **Expected Behavior**: Redirection to login page.
- **Result**: ![Non-logged-in Access Test](https://github.com/JesseRoss001/Community-Center/assets/79084912/d02c91fc-7ab5-4124-a8dd-6f201257914a)

### Search Event Access
- **Objective**: Confirm that non-logged-in members cannot search events.
- **Expected Behavior**: Restricted access.
- **Result**: Non logged in members cannot access search features.

### Event Booking Visibility
- **Objective**: Assess if event booking details are hidden from non-logged-in members.
- **Expected Behavior**: Booking details should not be visible.
- **Result**: ![Event Booking Test](https://github.com/JesseRoss001/Community-Center/assets/79084912/d02c91fc-7ab5-4124-a8dd-6f201257914a)
